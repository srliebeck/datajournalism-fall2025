I give the reporter a 5 for communicating the central insight of the article immediately. Right off the bat, I was able to tell that the reporter was going to be criticizing local Florida governments and school boards for their lack of initiative in making sure schools meet basic standards. This was made clear through words like "negelcted" in the headline. In addition, I knew the reporter was going to take a closer look at the reasons as to why these schools are underperforming so heavily, by seeing the word "how" in the headline.

There was no data visualization in this article, but I think there was enough data about school populations and test scores over time to constitute a line graph.

I would give the accuracy of this article a 3.5. As I was reading, I found myself questioning the comparisons that the reporter was making. They often cited their sources as to where they were getting data about the counties with the worst schools, but it is unclear how the comparisons were made to high acheiving schools. Some questions I would ask are:

- how big are the student bodies of the underperforming schools in question?

- are the teachers that are leaving going to other schools, or leaving the profession completely?

- what is the population of each of the towns mentioned, and what is the black population of each?

- what are the standards that are being assessed and tested?

Including this information on the demographics of the schools and communities in question would help clarify the accuracy of the data. I'd also urge the reporter to reach out to some additional outside sources, some of which include people who are named as being perpetuators of the problem:

- the principals and (former and present) superintendents of the schools

- teachers who have chosen to stay

- students who have graduated from these schools in the past decade

- the minority/dissenting school board members

- white members of neighboring communities

- students at the underperforming schools

I'd rank the quality of this article at a 4 because I thought all aspects of the schools increasingly underperforming were covered, specifically over time. However, I think some forms of data visualization could have been helpful to interpret the statistics they were noting. The anecdotes and quotes from both former teachers and parents helped add to the severity of the situation, and the reporter broke up the article into sections with headings and images that were helpful in making sure the article stayed organized and on topic.

I think the type and color used in this article made sense, as nothing seemed too fancy or showy for such a grave situation, but the occasional pictures did help in both grounding the article in reality, and reminding the reader that they're reading about actual schools and children in our country. The type was very clean and didn't change throughout the article, other than when transitioning to the title of a new section, so I give it a 5. The headings of each section drew my eye. I also give the color a 5 because it wasn't too overwhelming to the point where I couldn't focus on what I was reading, but was hekpful in breaking up the article. I liked how both type and color were used together, as each new heading was accompanied by an image.

In a similar vain, I give the creativity of this article a 4.5 because of the aforementioned use of images. However, as previously noted, I think the article would have benefitted from visualizations of the data instead of just writing all of it out.

# How the Redistricting in Texas will Affect Minority Voting Power

There is plenty of available data for this story, including:

- census data for Texas

- polling data for past Texas elections

- polling data for Rio Grande past elections versus upcoming elections

- Texas 2024 district map versus the new proposed one

This article would be incredibly timely because Greg Abbott just announced his plan to redistrict on August 29, which is an unprecedented move considering redistricting normally happens at the top of each decade when there is a census. The last redistricting was in 2020. This decision has also created a national redistircting frenzy as states across the country are trying to conbat this decision with their own redistricting. Finally, this decision and crisis comes right in time to directly affect the 2026 midterms.

Some helpful and important sources to lok into for this article would be:

- speaking to Texans who have been redistricted

- speaking to the chairs of the Texas Democrats

- speaking to people both against and in favor of the plan

- statistics on the Latino population in Texas based on the old map versus the proposed one
