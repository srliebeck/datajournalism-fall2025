## Reasoning

I turned this into a bar chart because I find it easier to visualize the data this way, as opposed to having to read through the table. I also only listed total earnings, as opposed to on and off the field, because that is what most people are reading the Forbes article for, and I didn't want too much visual clutter.

## Reasoning

I made this into a line chart because I thought too many bars on the original chart was visually overwhelming. I think the best chart type to use when comparing changes over time is a line chart. I also color coded each line to coordinate to one of the apps so that there only had to be four lines on the chart. It is easy to look at this and tell which is the most popular app, and which is the least popular at any given point in time.
