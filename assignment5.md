# Trauma deserts in rural America: Where you live can determine whether you live

## Lede

The author used an anecdotal lede for this story, describing a traumatic rescue that had to be made at a ravine in Western Colorado. The short anecdote describes how difficult it was for paramedics to conduct the rescue because of the steep terrain they had to traverse, but they were lucky that the nearest trauma hospital was just five minutes away. Because of this, the victim made it to the hospital alive. I think this was an effective way to start the story because until reading that the victim survived, readers were wondering what was going to happen. It was also effective at describing the types of obstacles and dangers that first responders encounter when trying to make a save in a more rural environment. However, I think this anecdote could've been even more effective if was circled back to and referenced again at the end of the story, maybe through a quote from the vivtim's experience. Simply having this anecdote at the beginning that sets up the point of the story is good, but it would have been better if it had more to do with the meat of the story.

## Data

The overall theme of the analysis was that different locations across the country have major disparities when it comes to where the nearest trauma response hospital is. The data involved a lot of studies and research about locations of these hospitals in relation to smaller and lower populated areas. For example, they note that their analysis shows that a quarter of all Americans live more than thirty minutes away from trauma centers, and that rural and western states run into even more trouble when trying to access these centers. However, this section of the article starts with "These analyses show:", but I found that this section was merely regurgitating the data and summarizing it without making any larger claims with analysis. But I did find later sections of the article to to do a better job at making substantial claims about the data, such as the "Unequal Resources" section. This section specifically uses the situation in eastern vs western Colorado to make a general claim about the disparaities in the American West, but this doesn't happen until halfway through the article.

## Sources

All of the sources for this article are experts, such as studies, specialists, or first responders. I found that these sources did agree with the data, as they highlighted the failures and discrepanices across the country when it comes to trauma centers. For example, the medical director quoted in the analysis section of the article is only quoted about how in a big city like Dallas, help will arrive quickly, but then only touches on the fact that rural areas don't receive the same help. Though this source doesn't expand upon the lack of resources in rural areas, it allows the reader to infer the challenges that these areas face. One thing I was confused about while looking at the sources in the first half of the article was the lack of citation. The article mentions "specialists" or "research", but doesn't cite the specific sources or incorporate any quotes. Though the latter half of the article picks this practice back up, I think the author should've cited their sources throughout, and especially in the beginning to establish a sense of authority for the reader.

## Story Structure

This article uses a martini glass structure, with the opening anecdote serving as the "important" point outlining the main idea of the article, that it can be a matter of life or death according to where the nearest trauma hospital is. The following sections are each labeled, discussing a different yet related aspect of the data. For example, the section titled "Rural-Urban Divide" talks a lot about cities and counties in Colorado, but so does the section "Unequal Resources". The use of subheadings and sections in this article helped break down the data and understand the bigger picture.
