# Trauma deserts in rural America: Where you live can determine whether you live

## Lede

The author used an anecdotal lede for this story, describing a traumatic rescue that had to be made at a ravine in Western Colorado. The short anecdote describes how difficult it was for paramedics to conduct the rescue because of the steep terrain they had to traverse, but they were lucky that the nearest trauma hospital was just five minutes away. Because of this, the victim made it to the hospital alive. I think this was an effective way to start the story because until reading that the victim survived, readers were wondering what was going to happen. It was also effective at describing the types of obstacles and dangers that first responders encounter when trying to make a save in a more rural environment. However, I think this anecdote could've been even more effective if was circled back to and referenced again at the end of the story, maybe through a quote from the vivtim's experience. Simply having this anecdote at the beginning that sets up the point of the story is good, but it would have been better if it had more to do with the meat of the story.

## Data

The overall theme of the analysis was that different locations across the country have major disparities when it comes to where the nearest trauma response hospital is. The data involved a lot of studies and research about locations of these hospitals in relation to smaller and lower populated areas. For example, they note that their analysis shows that a quarter of all Americans live more than thirty minutes away from trauma centers, and that rural and western states run into even more trouble when trying to access these centers. However, this section of the article starts with "These analyses show:", but I found that this section was merely regurgitating the data and summarizing it without making any larger claims with analysis. But I did find later sections of the article to to do a better job at making substantial claims about the data, such as the "Unequal Resources" section. This section specifically uses the situation in eastern vs western Colorado to make a general claim about the disparaities in the American West, but this doesn't happen until halfway through the article.

## Sources

All of the sources for this article are experts, such as studies, specialists, or first responders. I found that these sources did agree with the data, as they highlighted the failures and discrepanices across the country when it comes to trauma centers. For example, the medical director quoted in the analysis section of the article is only quoted about how in a big city like Dallas, help will arrive quickly, but then only touches on the fact that rural areas don't receive the same help. Though this source doesn't expand upon the lack of resources in rural areas, it allows the reader to infer the challenges that these areas face. One thing I was confused about while looking at the sources in the first half of the article was the lack of citation. The article mentions "specialists" or "research", but doesn't cite the specific sources or incorporate any quotes. Though the latter half of the article picks this practice back up, I think the author should've cited their sources throughout, and especially in the beginning to establish a sense of authority for the reader.

## Story Structure

This article uses a martini glass structure, with the opening anecdote serving as the "important" point outlining the main idea of the article, that it can be a matter of life or death according to where the nearest trauma hospital is. The following sections are each labeled, discussing a different yet related aspect of the data. For example, the section titled "Rural-Urban Divide" talks a lot about cities and counties in Colorado, but so does the section "Unequal Resources". The use of subheadings and sections in this article helped break down the data and understand the bigger picture.

## Numbers

There is very little incorporation of numbers in the individual paragraphs, but I was a little bogged down at times by the extremely long sentences. For example, in the "Rurual-Urban Divide" section, an entire paragraph is just one sentence: "But it leaves many of Coloradoâ€™s counties, more than half of which are rural, without timely access to care when people are seriously hurt, according to a 2019 study by researchers at Colorado State University and University of Colorado Health." This was a hard read, that left me feeling exhausted after reading just that one sentence, and has me wishing it was broken up. This is just one example of many in this article that could have benefitted from simply using less words, or breaking the sentence into two.

## Data Viz

There were three interactive maps in this story, and I do feel like all of them added to the theme of the story. Making all of these maps interactive was a smart move because it shows the prevalence of the problem throughout the country, allowing readers to get information on their own area and find out if they're at risk. However, the first map notes how the distances for the map were calculated, but the second and third maps don't cite anything. Both maps have a scale at the top to dindicate what the colors mean, but the scales use seemingly arbitrary numbers. Upon further inspection, I realized that the numbers represented the state with the highest and lowest number of deaths for each respective map, but a note about what the numbers represented and how they were chosen would have been nice.

## Methods

The suthor does do a good job acknowledging the nuances of the situation throughout the article, such as in the "Rural-Urban Divide" section, when it is noted that it makes sense for there to be more hospitals in more densely populated areas, but then it goes on to "refute" that argument by noting that more than half of Colorado's counties are rural. The same is seen in the "Limping it By" section, when the Cjief of Health Paramedics for Gunnison County explained that funding all comes down to numbers, and oftentimes rural areas just don't have enough calls coming in to justify more funding. After this important nuance, the article goes back to explaining how this problem is affecting different areas of the country. The end of the article features an "About Our Series" box that details the years of research that has gone into this story, different sources used, and even has a link to another story in the series about key takeaways from the investigation. I found this box to be super helpful in terms of giving context to this story and the fact that it's a series, and research is ongoing.

## Etc

One big question I had throughout the story was what constitued a level 1 and 2 trauma center, and what the difference between the two is. I think this information would've been helpful for readers to understand why a regular hospital or emergency room wouldn't suffice for all injuries. I also wondered why there was such a large emphasis on CJ Malcom's move to Gunnison County, as it didn't set up a specific story about a save he made or an accident he had, that I thought would follow. Instead, it just gave a lot of background information on Malcom, who was used as a source in the story, but not any more than other ones. Finally, in the "Beautiful Yet Hostile Section" I did notice a typo as I was reading: "At least once a year year...". This is a silly mistake that doesn't impact the data at all, but something that could put readers off and should've been fixed or checked before publication.
