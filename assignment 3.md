# Question: What is the most common offense in the most crime ridden neighborhood cluster?

This question is newsworthy because it is important for people to know what they are at risk of seeing or experiencing, especially those who live in the most crime ridden area. Further it is important for people (especially students) to know which neighborhood cluster has the most crime so they know what precautions to take if they go there.

# Steps to answer the question

1. copy the data into a new tab

2. insert a pivot table by clicking on any cell, navigating to "insert", and select pivot table

3. find the most crime ridden neighborhood

-  put "neighborhood cluster" in the rows section

-  put "offense" in the values section

-  sort the data from largest to smallest to find the most crime ridden neighborhood cluster (cluster 14)

4. edit the pivot table to find most common offense in cluster 14

-  put "offense" in the rows section

-  put "neighborhood clusters" in the columns section

-  put "shift" in the values section

-  sort from largest to smallest to look for most common offense (theft/other)
